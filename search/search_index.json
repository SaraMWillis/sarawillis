I actively curate and update public-facing system documentation and create training videos available through our YouTube channel. Additional responsibilities include creating and maintaining system software to improve the usability of HPC systems that use the Slurm scheduling system.</p> <p>Scientific Analyst University of Arizona, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology  Full-time Jun 2017 - Jun 2019  Tucson, Arizona</p> <p>Performed scientific research focused on long term trends in protein evolution. Operated in a technical role developing scripts to process, store, visualize, and analyze large quantities of genomic data utilizing a remote Linux cluster. </p> <p>Curated all genomic project data, developed complex bioinformatics pipelines to download and annotate all protein-coding sequences from over 400 species via online FTP repositories. Maintained and managed the MySQL databases using specialized scripts. Created and managed the GitHub repository: https://github.com/MaselLab/ProteinEvolution. Managed script and data submissions from a five-person team while enforcing best-practice guidelines. Supervised an undergraduate student, answered broad as well as technical questions, and assisted in debugging code. Second author on resulting manuscript published January 8, 2021 in eLife.</p> <p>Research Assistant University of Arizona, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Jun 2016 - Jun 2017  Tucson, Arizona</p> <p>Conducted bioinformatics research studying overlapping viral genes. Developed pipelines, created and utilized MySQL databases, and performed descriptive and inferential statistics using linear mixed models as well as other approaches. First author on the resulting manuscript published on September 1, 2018 in Genetics as a highlighted article.</p>"},{"location":"cv/#education","title":"Education","text":"<p>University of Arizona Bachelor of Science (BS), Physics and Mathematics (Double Major) 2014 - 2017</p>"},{"location":"cv/#projects","title":"Projects","text":"HPC Website Development https://hpcdocs.hpc.arizona.edu/link-variant <p>Transitioned the University of Arizona\u2019s HPC website from Confluence to a new static site using Material for MkDocs. Rewrote the content in a more user-friendly format and collaborated with the web team to deploy the site. Created a GitHub repository and automated the build and deployment process using a GitHub workflow and AWS CLI to sync with an AWS bucket</p> Customized HPC Cluster Scripts https://github.com/SaraMWillis/slurm-wrapperslink-variant <p>Developed a suite of customized scripts for the HPC cluster to enhance user experience. These scripts display cluster usage, gather job data, and provide detailed allocation information, making the system more user-friendly and accessible for researchers.</p> NAMD GPU Runtime Debugging 2023 <p>Resolved a critical issue with erratic NAMD GPU run times reported by users. After extensive investigation, I identified that Slurm was spreading CPU allocations across two sockets, causing CPU-GPU affinity problems. Collaborated with the infrastructure team to implement a configuration change that forced CPU affinity, resulting in consistent performance improvements for users.</p> Benchmarking Data Transfer Speeds https://github.com/SaraMWillis/Cloud_Storage_Benchmarkinglink-variant <p>Conducted benchmarking analyses of data transfer speeds between HPC and Google Drive to evaluate its viability as a backup solution. This analysis was prompted by the transition from local storage to a new all-flash 2 PB array, which provided less space compared to previous spinning disks. The findings contributed to informed decision-making regarding data management strategies.</p>"},{"location":"cv/#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<p>Catherine A. Weibel, Andrew L.
